  <h2>Role</h2>
  <p>
    I was the sole contributor to this design case. I conducted my own research
    and made all visual and interaction designs.
  </p>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Texting and driving is a leading cause of death in the U.S.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also completely preventable. However, it is naive to think that ad
    campaigns and fines alone can prevent addictive texting behavior in young
    adults from hitting the road.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to rethink our means of digital communication and redesign the
    messaging experience with the expectation that some people will inevitably
    text and drive.
  </p>
  <h2>Insights</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>1. Active Screen Attention</strong> <br />
    Reading and composing text messages require active screen attention for many
    seconds at a time, which is highly dangerous while operating a fast-moving
    vehicle. Also, texting with one hand is significantly slower than texting
    with both, exacerbating the distraction time. This redesign must reduce
    active screen time to ~0 seconds and make it easy to send messages with one
    hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2. Familiar UI</strong> <br />
    User behavior in messaging is already deeply engrained in smartphone users.
    Instead of creating an entirely new messaging experience, I chose to
    leverage existing behaviors to help users comfortably learn and use the new
    messaging platform. It is important for user to be able to perform core
    messaging actions naturally.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3. Conversational</strong> <br />
    In redesigning the messaging experience, it is important to retain and
    improve upon the core value of messaging apps - long-distance conversations.
    This messaging app should be highly conversational and bring friends closer
    together.
  </p>
  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>
    By designing a mobile messaging application that puts
    <strong>voice messaging first</strong>
    and is focused on <strong>one-hand use</strong>, users will find it
    <strong>more expressive</strong> and <strong>safer to use</strong> than
    text-centric messaging applications.

  <h2>Design System</h2>

  <h2>Voice Messaging</h2>
  <p>
    Sending and receiving voice messages is the core functionality of this app.
    The voice messaging feature was designed to be intuitive and familar with an
    emphasis on safety and one-hand use.

  <h2>Chatroom</h2>
  <p>
    The chatroom feature brings users closer together through live voice
    communication. This is an essential feature that highlights the
    conversational nature of the app.

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    Moving forward, I would like to conduct usability tests on my designs in
    addition to broader group-psychology tests.
  </p>
  <p>
    While conducting user research, I found many American testers felt awkward
    speaking out loud in public places just to message others. For this design
    to be successful, I need to assess both my app design and the psychological
    and societal friction against widespread voice messaging adoption in the
    States. Further exploration to come!
